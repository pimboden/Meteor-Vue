# Meteor-Vue

Just he implementation of the project as decribed in 
https://guide.meteor.com/vue.html#introduction removed the bogus 

import './main.html'; 

Developed in Windows 10
Installed Meteor (as admin)
Because I work with GitBash added this hack 
https://forums.meteor.com/t/how-to-config-meteor-command-in-git-bash-on-window-7/9703

Started Editor (VsCode) as admin.. Failed compiling, restarted on or 2 times and suddendly it starts working 
(guess the packages get loaded in incorrect order)

Before starting meteor use 

meteor reset... don't know what it exctly does.. but it worked for me
